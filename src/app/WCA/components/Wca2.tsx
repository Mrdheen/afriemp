                At Women Community in Africa (WCA), we are committed to <br />
                driving positive change for women and children across the <br />
                continent. As the advocacy arm of Beyond Mentors Community <br />
                Care Initiatives, we collaborate with NGOs, CSOs, and grassroots <br />
                organizations to tackle pressing social issues. From addressing<br />
                Gender-Based Violence (GBV) to promoting education and <br />
                empowerment, WCA is a coalition of hope, action, and solutions.
